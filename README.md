# About esx job radios:
Radios for different jobs.

I did NOT create the Code. I only edited the [esx_radio](https://github.com/danini1705/esx_radio) code.
If you want me to remove this hit me up in the discord server linked below.

Default button to speak is `CAPS`, you can change this very easily if you have a very little bit of experience with FiveM plugins and such.
You do need to press your push to talk button while pressing `CAPS` or use voice activation. In roleplay push to talk is way better tho.

# Requirements:
The job for which you will get the radio.

# Download & Installation:
1) Download the .zip.
2) Extract the .zip or Open the .zip.
3) Place `esx_ambulanceradio`, `esx_policeradio` or `esx_mechanicradio` in your ESX Directory
4) Add `esx_ambulanceradio`, `esx_policeradio` or `esx_mechanicradio` to your server.cfg
